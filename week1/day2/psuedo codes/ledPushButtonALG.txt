
1 configure the system clock as HS and define crystal frequancy
2 start the program
3 start the main program
4 make RB0 as INPUT using TRIS register
5 make RC0 as OUTPUT using TRIS register
6 clear the RBPU in INTCON2bits for make all pullup resistor active in the B port
7 clear the RC0 turn off
8 start the infinte loop
9 check value of RB0 using port registors
10 if value is 0 then turn the LED (RC0) otherwise turnoff
