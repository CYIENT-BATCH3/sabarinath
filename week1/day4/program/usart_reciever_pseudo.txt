
1 defiening corresponding crystal frequancy
2 make RB0 as output and clear RB0 for LED
3 make RB1 as ouput and clear the BIT for LED
4 make RC6 as ouput (act as a transmitter)
5 make RC7 as in put as recievr
6 set SPBRG register to 31 to make the baudrate at 9600
7 set TXSTA register to 0x20 to make corresponding bits active
8 infinite loop
9 check for RCIF to become 1 for succesfull reception
10 used for error free reception 
11 read the RCREG buffer to any variable
12 compare the variable and turn on LED according to the value
