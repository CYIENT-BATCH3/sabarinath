
1 intilize the hardware perheral such as clock 
2 defien correponding macros such as crystal frequancy as 20MHZ and declare the enumerated datatype for different pattern
3 start the main program
4 direct portc as output and port b as input
5 enable RBPU in INTCON2 register 
6 clear all the pin PORT C
7 start the infinite loop
8 check the input 
9 according to input give corresponding pattern hex value to PORT C
